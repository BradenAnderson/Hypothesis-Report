# Hypothesis-Report

As part of the Master of Science in Data Science program at SMU, I got the opportunity to take a statistics class where we learned to apply various types of statistical tests using both the SAS and R programming languages. 

As a lover of all things Python, I thought it would be fun to further explore these concepts by reimplementing many of the things I learned using Python. This repository represents one of my side projects where I set out to do just that. In some cases I lean on [SciPy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html) or [Statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html) to make the implementation much smoother, but in many others the algorithms are created completely from scratch with only Python and Numpy. This has turned out to be a great way to reinforce my statistics learning, and has indeed been a lot of fun.

I think this repository could be the start of what could one day be an interactive app that allows the user to easily perform various types of hypothesis tests, perhaps built around [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) or even [RShiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)! (I am not certain how feasible it would be to create an RShiny app built around a bunch of python code, but [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24901021/is-it-possible-to-run-a-python-script-in-r-shiny) leads me to believe it may be possible!) 

I initially wanted to wait until I had a completed product to create a repository for this, however the more I learn I've found my TODO list for this project has began growing much faster than its shrinking! As I continue my statistics education, I will try to add any new files I create here, in addition to updating the existing ones. Hopefully one day I will have a link to a working app to share as well.

Any ideas, suggestions, or code improvements are always welcome! If this project is interesting to you and is something you'd like to work on together, feel free to reach out: BradenAndersonEE@gmail.com
